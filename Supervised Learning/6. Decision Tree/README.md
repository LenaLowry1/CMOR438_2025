# Decision Tree and Regression Tree Model

Decision Trees are non-parametric, supervised learning models used to make predictions based on learned decision rules derived from data features. Essentially, a decision tree makes inferences about what features are important in order to produce its classification rules. It produces a piecewise function, used to partition the data. The 'tree' works like a **directed graph** with the data flowing from the root node to a leaf representing its category.

They are popular because they:

- Are intuitive and easy to interpret
- Can handle both numerical and categorical data
- Work for both classification and regression problems
- Require minimal data preprocessing

Some disadvantages include:

- With too many layers, the model can **overfit** to the training data
- If data is rotated, it can lead to decreased performance, even if nothing else is changed
- Outliers can cause the boundaries to take on strange shapes

A decision/regression tree is composed of:

- Root Node: The starting point that splits the data based on a feature

- Decision Nodes: Intermediate nodes where further splitting occurs

- Leaf Nodes: Terminal nodes that hold the final prediction value

Each split is made to reduce impurity (e.g., gini score or squared error in regression) and improve the modelâ€™s ability to predict the target variable.

## The datasets

For the decision tree, we will use the [`make_circles`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_circles.html) method to generate mock data. For the regression tree, we will use [`make_regression`](https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_regression.html). Both are from [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
