# Supervised Learning

Supervised machine learning is foundational in the field of artificial intelligence. Through this directory, we explore  models that learn to make predictions or decisions based on labeled datasets. In this framework, each piece of training data consists of an input feature vector and a corresponding, known output label. The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to infer a mapping function from inputs to outputs that generalizes well to unseen data. During training, the algorithm adjusts internal parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual output values, typically measured by a loss function. This iterative process allows the model to learn patterns, relationships, and structures within the data. 

Once trained, the model can be deployed to make predictions on new, unlabeled data by applying the learned mapping. Supervised learning tasks are broadly categorized into classification and regression problems. In classification, the model predicts a discrete label or category—such as determining whether an email is spam or not. Examples of classification algorithms include decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks. In regression tasks, the output is a continuous numerical value—for instance, predicting a house’s price based on its features. Popular regression methods include linear regression and logistic regression. 

The effectiveness of supervised learning hinges on the quality and representativeness of the labeled data, as well as the model's ability to capture underlying trends without overfitting to noise. This approach is widely used in fields such as medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, speech recognition, and image classification, where past data with known outcomes can be leveraged to inform future predictions.
